	<b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
<b>Abeliophyllum distichum</b> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
white, not yellow, flowers.<br>
It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
ameter.<br>
It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
America.
