Ageratum (/əˈdʒɛrətəm/),[2] (whiteweed in the USA), is
a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate flow-
ering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae,
tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
America and Mexico but four are native to the United
States.[3]<br>
They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height
of 30 in. The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or
tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate.
The leaves form compact clusters.<br>
The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white;
and spread in small compound umbels. They give small,
dry fruits.
